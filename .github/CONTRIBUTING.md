First of all, thanks for helping out!

## Submitting Bug Reports

1.  Most importantly, make sure the bug is not a security issue. Report any security issues to CLa@spotswoodcollege.school.nz
2.  Please make sure that, before you open an issue, you ensure the bug has not already been reported. Use the search tool under Issues to find relevant issues. If you find an open issue, give it a [thumbs up](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/), then proceed to step 4. If you find a closed issue, continue to step 3, and mention the closed issue in your new one.
3.  Now, open an issue with the Bug Report template. Fill in all the fields, making sure that you give clear and detailed instructions. Add the 'bug' label.
