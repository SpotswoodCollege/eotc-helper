# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
# one:                {}
# column:             value
#
# two:                {}
# column:             value

# Much happiness when the original fixtures were commented out. See https://stackoverflow.com/q/9936969/3574393
